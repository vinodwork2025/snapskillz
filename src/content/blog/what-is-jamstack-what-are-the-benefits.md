JAMstack is&nbsp;a modern web development architecture for building fast, secure, and scalable websites by decoupling the frontend and backend using JavaScript, APIs, and Markup (HTML).&nbsp;It works by pre-rendering sites into static pages at build time, which are then distributed via a Content Delivery Network (CDN).&nbsp;This eliminates the need for traditional dynamic servers, enhancing performance, security, and scalability by serving assets directly from a CDN.

&nbsp;

Key Components

**JavaScript****:**Primarily used on the client-side for dynamic elements and interactions, making the user experience more interactive without relying on a server.&nbsp;**APIs****:**Reusable APIs are used for accessing dynamic data and third-party services, allowing for custom logic and functionality without managing a complex backend.&nbsp;**Markup****:**Pre-built and highly optimized HTML pages are generated during the build process.&nbsp;How it Works

**Pre-rendering:**&nbsp;The frontend is pre-built into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.&nbsp;**Decoupling:**&nbsp;The code, site infrastructure, and content are separated into distinct components.&nbsp;**Content Delivery Network (CDN):**&nbsp;The pre-rendered static assets are distributed across a CDN.&nbsp;**Client-side Execution:**&nbsp;When a user requests a page, it is served directly from the CDN, allowing for extremely fast delivery times.&nbsp;**APIs for Dynamic Content:**&nbsp;For dynamic features, the client-side JavaScript interacts with APIs to fetch data or execute business logic on demand.&nbsp;Benefits

**Performance:**Faster load times because pages are pre-rendered and served from a CDN.&nbsp;**Security:**Enhanced security by eliminating traditional server-side vulnerabilities and reducing the attack surface.&nbsp;**Scalability:**The architecture is inherently more scalable as CDNs can handle large traffic spikes efficiently.&nbsp;**Developer Experience:**A modern development workflow, often with improved developer experience and easier
